#Questions and answers
## 1. Difference between String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder in Java?
Ans :
1. String is immutable.
2. StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable
3. StringBuffer is synchronized
4. StringBuilder is not synchronized

## 2. Difference between HashMap and Hashtable in Java? 
1. HashMap and Hashtable are based upon hash table data structure
2. HashMap is non-synchronized while Hashtable is synchronized
3. HashMap allows a null key but Hashtable doesn't
## 3. Difference between TreeSet and TreeMap in Java? 
1. Both are sorted collections.
2. TreeSet is based on Set data structure that doesn't allow duplicate
3. TreeMap is an implementation of Map interface

## 4. Externalizable vs Serializable
1. In case of Externalizable, it's the programmer who should take care of the whole serialization and also deserialization process
2. If we need to serialize the entire object, the Serializable interface is a better fit. On the other hand, for custom serialization, we can control the process using Externalizable.
3. The java.io.Serializable interface uses reflection and metadata which causes relatively slow performance. By comparison, the Externalizable interface gives you full control over the serialization process
4. While using Externalizable, it's mandatory to read all the field states in the exact order as they were written.
##5. Difference between transient and volatile in Java?
Transient keyword is used in Serialization while volatile is used in multi-threading
##6. Difference between Association, Composition, and Aggregation?


##======SpringBoot Question====
##1. How Spring boot internally works?
#### 1. Spring boot application execution will start from the main() method.
#### 2. The main() method internally call SpringApplication.run() method.
#### 3. SpringApplication.run() method performs bootstrapping for our spring boot application.
#### 4. Starts StopWatch to identify the time taken to bootstrap the spring boot application.
#### 5. Prepares environment to run our spring boot application (dev, prod, qa, uat).
#### 6. Print banner ( Spring Boot Logo prints on console).
#### 7. Start the IOC container ( ApplicationContext) based on the classpath ( default, Web servlet/ Reactive).
#### 8. Refresh context.
#### 9. Trigger Runners (ApplicationRunner or CommandLineRunner).
#### 10. Return ApplicationContext reference ( Spring IOC) .

## 3. What Is the Minimum Baseline Java Version for Spring Boot 3?

## 4. Why do we need a spring-boot-maven plugin?

The Spring Boot Maven plugin provides many convenient features:
1. It collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single, runnable "Ã¼ber-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.
2. It searches for the public static void main() method to flag as a runnable class.
3. It provides a built-in dependency resolver that sets the version number to match Spring Boot dependencies. You can override any version you wish, but it will default to Bootâ€™s chosen set of versions.
4. The Spring Boot Plugin has the following goals.
5. Spring-boot:run runs your Spring Boot application.
6. Spring-boot:repackage repackages your jar/war to be executable.
7. Spring-boot:start and spring-boot:stop to manage the lifecycle of your Spring Boot application (i.e. for integration tests).
9. Spring-boot:build-info generates build information that can be used by the Actuator.

## 5 How to Change Default Embedded Tomcat Server Port and Context Path in Spring Boot Application?
1. server.port=8080
2. server.servlet.context-path=/springboot2webapp

## 5 How static,instance and constructor referenceing works in java stream?
In Java Streams, method references provide a shorthand syntax for lambda expressions that simply call a method. They make your code more concise and readable. There are three main types of method references used in streams:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Static Method Reference
Syntax: ClassName::staticMethodName
This refers to a static method of a class. Itâ€™s used when the lambda expression calls a static method.
âœ… Example:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Atish", "Neha", "Ravi");
names.stream()
     .map(String::toUpperCase) // Equivalent to name -> String.toUpperCase(name)
     .forEach(System.out::println);


Another example with a custom static method:
public class Utils {
    public static String addPrefix(String name) {
        return "Mr. " + name;
    }
}

List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Atish", "Neha");
names.stream()
     .map(Utils::addPrefix)
     .forEach(System.out::println);



ðŸ”¹ 2. Instance Method Reference (of a particular object)
Syntax: instance::instanceMethodName
Used when you want to call an instance method on a specific object.
âœ… Example:
public class Printer {
    public void print(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}

Printer printer = new Printer();
List<String> messages = Arrays.asList("Hello", "World");

messages.stream()
        .forEach(printer::print); // Equivalent to msg -> printer.print(msg)



ðŸ”¹ 3. Instance Method Reference (of an arbitrary object of a particular type)
Syntax: ClassName::instanceMethodName
Used when the lambda calls an instance method on the stream element itself.
âœ… Example:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Atish", "Neha", "Ravi");

names.stream()
     .map(String::toLowerCase) // Equivalent to name -> name.toLowerCase()
     .forEach(System.out::println);



ðŸ”¹ 4. Constructor Reference
Syntax: ClassName::new
Used to create new objects in a concise way, especially useful with map() or collect().
âœ… Example:
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Atish", "Neha");

List<Person> people = names.stream()
                           .map(Person::new) // Equivalent to name -> new Person(name)
                           .collect(Collectors.toList());

î·™î·š
Assuming:
public class Person {
    private String name;
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
